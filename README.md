ENCRYPTED


Encrypted is a Cyber Security Web Development project that aimed to develop a secure communication application. This application allows users to create chatrooms and exchange encrypted messages, photos, and files with each other using a 256-bit encryption algorithm. To ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data, the application uses end-to-end encryption and digital signatures to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

The project also implemented several measures to prevent cyber attacks, including limiting access to the controller and backend servers, and implementing input validation and sanitization. The front end of the application was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a beautiful and functional interface for users to securely communicate with each other.

Overall, Encrypted is an excellent example of a project that prioritizes data security and privacy, providing a reliable and safe way for users to communicate with each other over the internet.
